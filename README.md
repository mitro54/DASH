## ... [<span style="color:#ff00ff">-</span>] DAIS

- In researching / early development stage

## What
- DAIS is a PTY (pseudoterminal) shell wrapper. 
- Core will be written in C++, that will support Python scripts as extensions to the core. 

## Scope
- Projects scope is to create a helpful open source extension for Data / AI Engineers or like minded people in their day-to-day tasks, running in their favorite shell.
- This project will use present technologies and as an open-source, allows others to contribute their ideas and features to it as well.
- Allows Python scripts so other Data / AI oriented people can create plugins in the language they are most confident in.
